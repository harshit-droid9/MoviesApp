# MoviesApp

We built MoviesApp using modern Android best practices with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Room.
The app integrates with the TMDb API to fetch trending movies, supports real-time search
functionality, and implements offline caching to ensure a smooth user experience even when
connectivity is limited.

# Key Features

### List Screen:

Displays movies trending this week, providing an engaging and dynamic overview of current popular
titles.

### Search Screen:

Allows users to quickly search for movies by title, updating results in real time as the query
changes.

### Detail Screen:

Offers an in-depth view of each movie, including details such as the overview, release date,
ratings, and highâ€‘quality images.

# API Used

### TMDb API:

We use the TMDb API to retrieve trending movies and detailed movie information. This integration
ensures that users have access to the latest film data including images, summaries, and release
dates.
